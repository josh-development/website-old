## FAQ

### What is Josh?

Josh is quite simply the easiest storage system you'll ever encounter. Josh makes it simple to store any JSON-based data effectively into any popular database back-end using providers.

### Why use Josh?

Josh makes it extremely easy and simple to get a project up and running as quickly as possible with very little effort when it comes to the database interaction layer. It does this by removed the complexity of setting up and ORM or learning a database language, while still giving you all the power.

### When NOT to use Josh?

If you think you can do better, if you already know database interactions or ORMs, or you don't trust database wrappers made by other people... Well, in any of those cases I don't even know why you're on this page, go on now, `git out --of:here` and go make some good applications, you don't need this!
