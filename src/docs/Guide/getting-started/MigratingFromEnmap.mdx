# Migrating from Enmap

While Josh and Enmap are based on the same basic concepts and ideas.
This being said, there are still many changes that wull need to happen in your code if you want to migrate from Enmap to Josh.

## Why should I migrate?

You should not migrate to Josh, "because it's newer".
Josh is not an upgrade to Enmap, it's an entriely different package altogether.

Anyways, here are a few reasons you should migrate:

- It can be used accross multiple processes.
  This is useful for projects such as a Discord bot which may need sharding or access to a database in an API backend _and_ frontend.
- It has provider support, so it not only supports SQLite, but also Mongo, JSON, and many more.
- It has bundles in ESM, CommonJS, and UMD.
  This makes it possible for you to use Josh in many different project environments.

## Prequisites

- Josh utilizes promises _everywhere_, so you need to be familiar with them.
  If you don't know how to use promises, you can learn them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
- Make a backup of your project's database files before you migrate.

## Migrating

This part is actually quite simple if you follow the instructions below carefully.
Most likely you have not learned a lot about Josh, how it works, and how to use it.
If so, please reference the [Introduction](/docs/Guide/getting-started/introduction) guide.

### Data Migration

To start out we can create a new file called `migrations.js` somewhere where you keep source files in your project.
Remember, anywhere we use the `provider` keyword should reference the provider you are using in your project.

<Codeblock type="TYPESCRIPT_ESM_COMMONJS">
  <CodeblockContent type="TYPESCRIPT_ESM_COMMONJS" index={CodeblockIndex.TypeScript}>
    ```typescript
    import Enmap from 'enmap';
    import { Josh } from '@joshdb/core';
    import { MyProvider } from '@joshdb/provider';

    // Initialize your Enmap instance.
    // Make sure all options coordinate with your options in the rest of your project.
    // However, we must make sure to use the "fetchAll" option here.
    const source = new Enmap({
      name: 'source',
      fetchAll: true
    });

    // Initialize your Josh instance.
    // Remember to add any options to your provider if needed.
    const target = new Josh({
      name: 'target',
      provider: new MyProvider()
    });

    // Create a migration function.
    async function migrate() {
      // Ensure sure the "source" is ready.
      await source.defer;

      // Let's log how many keys we have in the source database.
      console.log(`Source database has ${source.count} rows.`);

      // Let's log how many keys we have in the target database.
      console.log(`Target database has ${await target.size()} rows.`);

      // Get the exported json data from Enmap.
      const data = source.export();

      // Import the data into Josh.
      await target.import(data);

      console.log(`Migration complete! Target database now has ${await target.size()} keys.`);
    }

    // Run the migration.
    migrate();
    ```

  <CodeblockContent type="TYPESCRIPT_ESM_COMMONJS" index={CodeblockIndex.ESM}>
    ```typescript
    import Enmap from 'enmap';
    import { Josh } from '@joshdb/core';
    import { MyProvider } from '@joshdb/provider';

    // Initialize your Enmap instance.
    // Make sure all options coordinate with your options in the rest of your project.
    // However, we must make sure to use the "fetchAll" option here.
    const source = new Enmap({
      name: 'source',
      fetchAll: true
    });

    // Initialize your Josh instance.
    // Remember to add any options to your provider if needed.
    const target = new Josh({
      name: 'target',
      provider: new MyProvider()
    });

    // Ensure sure the "source" is ready.
    await source.defer;

    // Let's log how many keys we have in the source database.
    console.log(`Source database has ${source.count} rows.`);

    // Let's log how many keys we have in the target database.
    console.log(`Target database has ${await target.size()} rows.`);

    // Get the exported json data from Enmap.
    const data = source.export();

    // Import the data into Josh.
    await target.import(data);

    console.log(`Migration complete! Target database now has ${await target.size()} keys.`);
    ```

  <CodeblockContent type="TYPESCRIPT_ESM_COMMONJS" index={CodeblockIndex.CommonJS}>
    ```typescript
    const Enmap = require('enmap');
    const { Josh } = require('@joshdb/core');
    const { MyProvider } = require('@joshdb/provider');

    // Initialize your Enmap instance.
    // Make sure all options coordinate with your options in the rest of your project.
    // However, we must make sure to use the "fetchAll" option here.
    const source = new Enmap({
      name: 'source',
      fetchAll: true
    });

    // Initialize your Josh instance.
    // Remember to add any options to your provider if needed.
    const target = new Josh({
      name: 'target',
      provider: new MyProvider()
    });

    // Create a migration function.
    async function migrate() {
      // Ensure sure the "source" is ready.
      await source.defer;

      // Let's log how many keys we have in the source database.
      console.log(`Source database has ${source.count} rows.`);

      // Let's log how many keys we have in the target database.
      console.log(`Target database has ${await target.size()} rows.`);

      // Get the exported json data from Enmap.
      const data = source.export();

      // Import the data into Josh.
      await target.import(data);

      console.log(`Migration complete! Target database now has ${await target.size()} keys.`);
    }

    // Run the migration.
    migrate();
    ```

### Changing your Code

Here is the more difficult part of the migration. You'll need to change your entire codebase for Josh.
As long as you follow these differences carefully you will be running your project using Josh in no time!

#### Keys & Paths

In Josh the key and path parameters are combined into a single parameter.
Below we will use `set()` as an example method:

```diff
- enmap.set('key', 'value');
+ await josh.set('key', 'value');

- enmap.set('key', 'path', 'value');
+ await josh.set('key.path', 'value');

- enmap.set('my.key', 'value');
+ await josh.set({ key: 'my.key' }, 'value');

- enmap.set('key', 'nested.path', 'value');
+ await josh.set('key.nested.path', 'value');
```

#### Methods

Below is a list of all methods and properties that have changes in their name, usage, and/or signatures.

```diff
- enmap.autnum;
+ await josh.autoKey();

- enmap.size;
- enmap.count;
+ await josh.size();

- enmap.array();
- enmap.values();
+ await josh.values();

- enmap.findAll();
+ await josh.filter();

- enmap.exists();
+ await josh.has();
```

Below is a list of all methods and properties that have not yet been added, but will be eventually.

- `observe()`

Methods that will not be implemented:

- `fetch()` and `fetchEverything()`. This is no longer required and is not relevant.
- `evict()`. This is no longer required and is not relevant.
- `changed()`. Cannot be implemented.
- `sweep()`, `clone()`, and `equals()`. This no longer required and is not relevant.
- `setProp()`, `pushIn()`, `getProp()`, `deleteProp()`, `removeFrom()`, and `hasProp()`. They're deprecated and can all be done with the simple key/path system.
- `filterArray()`. Unnecessary method.

## Conclusion

Alright, this is quite a hefty page, with a lot of information.
Thank you for using Josh and I hope you found this migration guide very informative!
