# What is middleware?

Middleware are simply a class that has methods that can be configured to run before and after providers received payloads from [`Josh`](https://github.com/josh-development/core/blob/main/src/lib/structures/Josh.ts).

They make it possible to implement functionalities like [`AutoEnsure`](https://github.com/josh-development/core/blob/main/src/middlewares/CoreAutoEnsure.ts).
